[Syntax translator](https://www.practo.com/medicine-info/syntran-100-mg-capsule-18930)

An interpreter written in Fortran, I guess

This is a sandbox for me to play in as I follow along with [Immo Landwerth's _building a compiler_ series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y)

## Build

    ./build.sh

## Run

Start the interpreter:

    ./syntran

Then enter arithmetic expressions like `1 + 2 * 3` in the interpreter:

    syntran$ 1 + 2 * 3
    1 + 2 * 3
    7
